# Connect Four game

My challenge was to build out this Connect Four game and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I could use any tools I liked to help me complete the challenge. So, if I had something I wanted to practice, I was free to give it a go.

I aimed for my users to be able to:

- View the game rules
- Play a game of Connect Four against another human player (alternating turns on the same computer)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

Bonus objectives:

- Play against the computer
